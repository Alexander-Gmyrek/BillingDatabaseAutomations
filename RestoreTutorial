# Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Use the Database Restore Script

This guide will walk you through the process of restoring your MySQL database using a simple script. No technical expertise is neededâ€”just follow these steps carefully.

## Before You Begin:

### Ensure You Have the Necessary Files:
- The script file (`restore.bat`).
- The backup file you want to restore (e.g., `sql_backup_20240101_1200.sql`).
- The backup files should be stored in the same directory.

### Know Your Database Information:
- The MySQL database name.
- The MySQL root username (usually `root`).
- The MySQL password.

## Step 1: Locate the Script and Backup Files

### Find the Folder:
- Go to the folder on your computer where the `restore.bat` script and the backup files are stored.
- You can do this by navigating through your file explorer (the folder icon on your taskbar).

### Open the Folder:
- Double-click on the folder to open it.
- Make sure you can see the `restore.bat` file and your backup files (.sql files).

## Step 2: Run the Restore Script

### Double-Click the Script:
- Find the `restore.bat` file in the folder.
- Double-click on `restore.bat`. This will open a black window called the Command Prompt.

### Enter the Backup File Name:
- After you double-click the script, a black window will appear asking you to "Enter the backup file name to restore."
- Type the name of the backup file you want to restore (e.g., `sql_backup_20240101_1200.sql`).
- **Important:** Make sure you type the file name exactly as it appears, including the `.sql` at the end.
- Press **Enter** on your keyboard.

### Wait for the Process to Complete:
- The script will start restoring the database. This might take a few moments, depending on the size of the backup file.
- You will see some messages in the black window (Command Prompt) as the script runs.

## Step 3: Confirm the Restore Was Successful

### Look for a Success Message:
- After the restore process is finished, the script will display a message saying "Database restored successfully."
- If you see this message, the database has been restored correctly.

### Check for Errors:
- If there is an issue during the restore, the script will show an error message.
- If you see an error, note down the message and contact someone who can help you troubleshoot it.

## Step 4: Close the Command Prompt

### Close the Window:
- Once you see the success message, you can close the black window (Command Prompt).
- To do this, click the X in the top-right corner of the window, or simply press any key when prompted.

## Step 5: Verify the Restoration (Optional)

### Check Your Database:
- If you know how to access your MySQL database (perhaps through a web interface or a database management tool), you can verify that the data has been restored correctly.
- If you're unsure how to do this, you can ask someone who manages the database for you to check it.

## You're Done!
You have successfully restored your MySQL database using the restore script. If you need to restore the database again in the future, just follow these same steps.

## Tips:
- Always make sure you have the correct backup file before restoring.
- If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to ask for help from someone with more technical knowledge.

This guide should make the process simple and straightforward, even if you're not familiar with using computers.
